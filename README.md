# static_wiki_tools
=================

## I need a tool to write wiki, I think it consists a simple markup language and a contents management system

## features

### markup:
+ # head1
+ ## head2
+ ### head3
+ ____ hr
+ blank line : end of paragraph
+ +: ordered list
+ *: unordered list

### how to use
put script file wiki.pl anywhere you want to generate static contents, and run it, you will see two empty folders then, move the file 'index.md' to the folder named src, and run the script again, you will see some files generated, open the *index.md* file, you will learn how to use the system.
