# static_wiki_tools
=================

## I need a tool to write wiki, I think it consists a simple markup language and a contents management system

## features

### markup:
+ # head1
+ ## head2
+ ### head3
+ ____ hr
+ blank line : end of paragraph
+ +: ordered list
+ *: unordered list

### how to use
run
`wiki init`
anywhere you want to generate static contents,you will see two empty folders then.
move the file 'index.md' to the folder named src, and run
`wiki process`
, you will see some files generated, open the `index.md` file, you will learn how to use the system.
run
`wiki new`
you will see new terms wait to be edit.
